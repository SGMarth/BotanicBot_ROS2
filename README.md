# BotanicBot_ROS2
Botanic Bot is an extended and customized version of the FarmBot ROS2 control system.
This repository contains the ROS2 workspace that powers movement, sensors, toolheads, and automation logic for the Botanic Bot deployed at UNCW’s greenhouse.

Built on top of the open-source FarmBot_ROS2 project by Petri J. F.
